[WARNING]
Mule Management Console (MMC) was deprecated in December 2015. Its https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#mule-management-console[End of Life] is July 15, 2019. For more information see the xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mmc-migrator-tool.adoc[MMC Migrator Tool] or contact your Customer Success Manager to determine how you can migrate to xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Manager].

This page takes you through the basics of setting up users via the Management Console. Refer to xref:managing-mmc-users-and-roles.adoc[Managing MMC Users and Roles] for information on setting user groups and assigning permissions.

[NOTE]
====
This page describes adding and managing users via the Management Console. You can also add and manage users using LDAP, but note that once you enable authentication through LDAP, the *Users* link is no longer available in the Management Console. See xref:setting-up-and-managing-users-via-ldap.adoc[Setting Up and Managing Users via LDAP] for more information.
====

== Assumptions

This document assumes you are an Administrator account holder in MMC.

== Adding New Users and Adding Them to User Groups

. On the Administration tab, click *Users* in the Manage section of the navigation tree on the left. The pane lists all current console users. Click the *New* button (circled in the figure below) to create a new user.

. Enter the user name that the user will enter when they log in to the Management Console, as well as the user's full name, email address, and password. (Note that the password must be at least five characters).

. Select at least one group from the *Available Groups* list. The new user will be added to the groups you select. Keep in mind that once the user joins a group, that user has the permissions granted to that group or groups. Use the right angle bracket (*>*) to move the selected role to *Joined Groups*.

[NOTE]
====
The default groups are Administrators, Deployers, Monitors, and Server Administrators. If you need to create more groups or roles, see xref:managing-mmc-users-and-roles.adoc[Managing MMC Users and Roles].

. Click *Save*.

== Editing Users

. On the Administration tab, click *Users*, and then click the username of the user you want to edit.
. Edit the user's name or email address if needed.
. If you need to reset the user's password, click *Reset Password*, enter the new password twice, and then click OK.
. To assign the user to a group, select the group in the Available Groups list and click *>* so that the group appears in Joined Groups. To remove the user from a group, select the group in the Joined Groups list and click *<*.
. When you have finished editing this user, click *Save*.

== Deleting Users
