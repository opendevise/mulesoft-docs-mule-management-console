[WARNING]
Mule Management Console (MMC) was deprecated in December 2015. Its https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#mule-management-console[End of Life] is July 15, 2019. For more information see the xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mmc-migrator-tool.adoc[MMC Migrator Tool] or contact your Customer Success Manager to determine how you can migrate to xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Manager].

The management console provides REST APIs that you can use to programmatically access much of the console's functionality. Using these REST APIs, you can:

* Register new servers and manage existing servers, including restarting servers.
* Manage server groups.
* Access and manage files on servers.

== Assumptions

This section assumes that you have a clear picture of the
xref:architecture-of-the-mule-management-console.adoc[Architecture of the Mule Management Console] and xref:installing-mmc.adoc[installed MMC]
